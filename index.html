            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> Linux is a type of computer operating system that is open source and has various types of distributions ranging 
                from slackware, redhat, centOs, Backtrack and so on.Linux OS is generally used by users who are 'proficient' in 
                technology, because its use requires certain skills, ranging from system installation, configuration to the use 
                of applications.</p>

        <div id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The forerunner of Linux is the UNIX operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1969. Ken and Dennis are also the inventors of the C programming language, which is the basis of high-level programming languages.
               UNIX source code is developed using the C language so that it is easy to transfer to various platforms. Therefore UNIX received great response and attention.
               With the development of UNIX very quickly, UNIX finally split into two streams, namely those developed by the University of Berkley and those developed by AT & T.
               It also resulted in many companies who want to take control in the field of operating systems. Therefore, the UNIX standard specification was established by the IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Engineers) with the development of Posix.
               Since then, there have been various types of UNIX, one of which is Minix, which was developed by the U.S. Tanenbaum which aims for education.
               Then in 1984 began to develop the GNU project by making software, compilers, editors, text formatters, GUIs, libraries, modules, and many more. GNU is designed to be compatible with existing operating systems, namely UNIX.
               In 1990 GNU has succeeded in making all the components needed to develop an operating system, namely compilers, libraries, applications, user interfaces. But there is one thing that is not finished, namely the kernel which is the core of the operating system.
               Then in 1991 Lunus Torvalds who is a student of the Department of Computer Science from the University of Helsinki wrote a kernel using the C language and translated it using the GNU C Compiler.
               Linus Torvalds uses the source code of Minix to be used as a reference for developing new operating systems whose source code can be accessed by anyone.
               Then the operating system developed by Linus Torvalds is called Linux. Initially Linus wanted to give the name Freax which is a combination of "free freak" and X which refers to Unix.
               In September 1991 Linus uploaded the files he had developed to an FTP server (ftp.funet.fi).
               Then a volunteer FTP administrator, Ari Lemmke, thought that Freax was not a good name for a kernel. Then he changed the kernel name to Linux without Linus' approval.
               In developing Linux, Linus uses tools from the Free Software Foundation and programs licensed by the GNU GPL (a license for free and free software).
               And this is where Linux version 0.01 was born. This version of Linux can not be called an operating system as a whole.
               Then on October 5, 1991, Linus Torvalds Linux source code which became the first official Linux version introduced to the public, namely Linux version 0.02 under the GNU GPL license.</p>
